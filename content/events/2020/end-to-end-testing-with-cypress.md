## Abstract

I will introduce End to End Testing, why you'd want to use it and some pros and cons. For those unfamiliar or uncomfortable with automated testing, I may pause to cover the basics, as we'll build on that in the talk. I'll then go over Cypress.IO, covering installation and use. I'll then walk through Cypress.IO's examples and focus on the more illustrative ones, taking time to mention some best practices and gotchas.
