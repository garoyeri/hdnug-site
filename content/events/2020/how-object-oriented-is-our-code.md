## Abstract

Every day we arrive to our work, we open the Visual Studio and we write code, code and more code. Often, we listen to what we have to write which is maintainable, extensible and bug free code. More often we are told that the good way of doing that is writing Object Oriented Code.

But, have you asked yourself, if your code follows the principles of Object Oriented Design? Have you asked yourself, if you can improve the quality of your code?

In this talk, I will be talking about OOP, I will try to show you the difference between the code that seems to be Object Oriented and the code that is Object Oriented.

I will wait for you to talk about the fantastic world of OOP.
