excerpt: |
  Tired of messing with SSRS? Wish there was an easier way to design and embed reports? Can the users do their own damn reports already! Well say hello to dotnet report. In this session we'll start from a blank project and we'll add ad hoc reporting using dotnet report and by connecting to a local sql database, learning how to leverage this front end open source solution to easily embed a robust and feature rich reporting solution with minimal efforts. We'll also cover how to embed it in an existing solution and discuss the architecture.
