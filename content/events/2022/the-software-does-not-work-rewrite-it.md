title: "The Software Does Not Work? Rewrite it!"
date: 2022-03-17
time: "18:30"
excerpt: |
  Outdated technology? Unmaintainable codebase? Politics? Those are just some of the reasons that cause software rewrites. Whether a rewrite is really needed or not, chances are we all work in such projects.

  Do we rewrite the entire software? Can we rewrite just parts of it? Where do we start? Can we automate the process?

  Since the early 2000s, I’ve worked in a variety of such projects. I’d like to share the most important lessons I’ve learned in these projects.

  In this talk, I’ll share some of the different types of rewrites and techniques, what I learned from it, and how it changed my way of approaching both software rewrites as well as greenfield projects.
